This is the website and blog of the [AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp) project (formerly known as hipSYCL / Open SYCL) - a modern SYCL and C++ standard parallelism offloading implementation with broad hardware support. Here, we discuss all things AdaptiveCpp, SYCL, and heterogeneous computing.
